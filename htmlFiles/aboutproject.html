            <li>When I had a problem I would go through the following steps until I found the solution: I would first check my code for small errors, then I would check the structure of my code, then I would use the inspect element on the page to see how toggling parts of my code on and off would affect it, I would then try and google a solution, then if all of these failed I would ask Mr. Drenth for help in class.<br>One instance I had a problem was how the title did not line up with the page perfectly, I checked my code for small errors, checked the structure of my code, attempted to google the solution, and finally I asked Mr. Drenth for help. He showed me how you can toggle parts of the code on and off to find what's causing the problem.<br>The following are links I used to help me with my project:<br><a href="https://www.quackit.com/css/properties/">https://www.quackit.com/css/properties/</a><br><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Hyperlink-with-HTML">https://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Hyperlink-with-HTML</a><br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp</a><br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp</a><br><a href="https://color.adobe.com/create">https://color.adobe.com/create</a><br><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp</a></li>
            <li>I started off with just the idea to make a quiz website, and from there after doing research on other sites I drew up a rough design. I wanted at the top centre to be a tile and sub-title, with a navigation banner/bar directly below. I wanted the main item of the page to be in the centre, or off to one side if there was an image. I also wanted a footer that would include some contact information.<br>I chose my color scheme based of the idea that I wanted the background to be grey, as I saw that in Mr. Drenth's website and I liked the look. I chose white for the container background and font color because I thought it contrasted well with the grey background. For the text boxes I knew I wanted something bright, so I tried some different colours and preferred blue. I chose the shade of blue using Adobe Color Wheel, I plugged in the colours I wanted and it told me which shade of blue best matched.<br>I did little to no time managment, I simply worked on a part of the project when I was working. I feel like this cost me in the long run as I struggled to understand the grid nd therefore spent a very long time trying to figure it out. This put me behind on the project, meaning I had to do a lot of the project just before it was due.</li>
            <li>For my website I tried to go with a simple design as I personally prefer the look. Despite the simplicity I still manged to include: an image, a navigation bar, an email link, an about section, a quiz, the quiz answers and an FAQ section. This added up to four different sections and 9 different web pages.<br>I believe that the main thing people visiting my website will appreciate is the simplicity in both the style and the design<br>If I was marking this project I would give it a 3+ as while it is simple it is well structured, and explores different ways html and css can be used.</li>
